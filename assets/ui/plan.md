### UI Roadmap

1. Simple layout engine with just position, padding, border, and margin
    Elements can have a single parent and multiple children
    Have a generic system of positioning so we can later implement units (percentages, pixels, centimeters)

2. Add styles on a per element basis (colors, border radius, text)
    Styles must override eachother correctly, especially when using multiple classes

3. Implement class inheritance from parent elements

4. Mouse interaction events to dynamically change element classes

5. Transitions / animations when changing from one class to another
